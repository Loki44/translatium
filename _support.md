### What is China Mode?
Because [google.com](https://google.com) is blocked in China, China Mode is developed to allow users in China to use the app. If this mode is turned on, Modern Translator will transmit data to and from Google Translate through domain [google.cn](http://google.cn) instead of [google.com](https://google.com). Be aware that unlike [google.com](https://google.com), [google.cn](http://google.cn) does not use the secure [HTTPS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).
